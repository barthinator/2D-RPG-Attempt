# 2D-RPG-Attempt
New to game making, am following a series of tutorials and planning on adding my own additions. Using Unity 5. Just wanted
to learn about game making and the basics of 2D. 

I have been following the video series from the youtuber RM2KDEV (https://www.youtube.com/user/rm2kdev)

Have been using some tilesets from open game art. Just been using the plain female character for now, planning on creating own
character art and tileset art, just have been working on the game mechanics for now.

What is completed so far:

1. Created some maps, using Tiled on mac. Was difficult figuring how to export with TiledToUnity to Unity on mac, but found a work around that has been working great.

2. Created the player and player animations, added an idle state and directional walking states

3. Created a camera class that handles the camera, it follows the player.

4. Added warping from one map to another.

5. Just finished making screen fading events for when the player "warps" to a different location.

Plans(No particular order):

1. Create own pixel art.

2. Add a turn based fighting implementation.

3. An enemy(s) entity and AI

4. Multiplayer implementation

5. User Interface

6. Save states

7. Inventory System
